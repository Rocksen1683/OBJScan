# OBJScan üì±‚ûúüõ†Ô∏è

## **Project Overview**  
OBJScan is an iOS application that allows users to detect objects using the device camera and convert them into **3D STL files** for 3D printing or modeling. The app integrates real-time object detection, 3D mesh generation, and export functionalities.

## **Features**  
- **Real-Time Object Detection**:  
  Detect objects using the camera with Apple‚Äôs Vision framework and Core ML.
- **3D STL File Generation**:  
  Convert detected objects into 3D models and export as STL files.
- **File Management**:  
  Save, view, and share STL files locally or to cloud storage.
- **User-Friendly Interface**:  
  Clean UI to interact with the camera, view detected objects, and manage 3D files.

### **Components**  
1. **UI Layer**:  
   - Camera View  
   - Object List and Export Screen  

2. **Object Detection Module**:  
   - **Core ML** with Vision API to detect objects.  

3. **Mesh Generation Module**:  
   - Converts 2D boundaries into 3D meshes.  
   - Exports the 3D model as an STL file.

4. **Storage and Export Module**:  
   - Save files locally.  
   - iOS Share Sheet for exporting files.
